### **3. Features**

#### **3.1. NVR System Management**

* **Add NVR System:** Users can add a new NVR system by providing a server URL, a username, and a password. The application will attempt to connect to the NVR using these credentials.
* **Save NVR Credentials:** Upon successful connection, the application will securely store the NVR's credentials on the device for future one-tap connections.
* **NVR System List:** The app will maintain a list of all saved NVR systems, allowing the user to select which one to connect to.
* **Default NVR System:** Users can designate one NVR system as the "default." When the app is launched, it will automatically attempt to connect to this default system.

#### **3.2. Main Application Interface**

* **Tab Bar Navigation:** The main screen of the application will feature a tab bar at the bottom with five distinct categories:
    * Camera (Default)
    * Storage
    * Network
    * Account
    * System
* **Default Tab:** Upon successful connection to an NVR system, the "Camera" tab will be the default view.

#### **3.3. Camera Tab**

* **Camera List:** This tab will display a list of all cameras currently connected to the active NVR system. Each item in the list should display basic information, such as the camera name or model.
* **Camera Detail Screen:** Tapping on a camera in the list will navigate the user to a detailed view of that specific camera.
* **Edit Camera Information:** Within the camera detail screen, users will have the ability to edit certain camera parameters. The initial editable field will be the camera's IP address.

#### **3.4. Future-Scoped Tabs (Placeholder)**

The following tabs will be present in the tab bar but will be functionally empty in the initial release. They serve as placeholders for future feature expansion.

* **Storage Tab:** (No functionality in this version)
* **Network Tab:** (No functionality in this version)
* **Account Tab:** (No functionality in this version)
* **System Tab:** (No functionality in this version)
